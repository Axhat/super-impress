# Svelte (with SvelteKit)

The v0 was built with React and it was great.

React is a [default choice](https://www.lorenstew.art/blog/react-won-by-default/) for many.

But this is a serious product while also a learning initiative.

Svelte is an equally good (if not better) choice for most products and I want to personally push more Svelte out there and give folks a chance to appreciate something other than React.

We will struggle a bit while building with Svelte literally due to lack of skill but learning anything new [never goes waste](https://youtube.com/shorts/mWF5jsTHiWs?feature=shared)!
